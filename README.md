# Crunch o'Clock
MSCH-C220 Game Jam, April 2022

## Theme : Time Crunch
We used this theme to create a 2D platformer in which the user races against time to reach the final door, while avoiding enemies and skillfully maneuvering.

## Game Play
Try to get to the end of the levels as quick as possible and making sure you stay away from enemies!

## Impediments
We started by creating a 2D platformer but ran into problems with the coin and score structure, causing us to change the win condition. 

## Implementation
Menus,
Enemies, 
Score, 
Advanced Player Movement,
Multiple Levels
